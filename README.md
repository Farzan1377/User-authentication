# user-authentication
A user authentication service (register, login, password checker, encryption, etc)

This is a project I wrote in Xcode IDE using Objective-C programming language.
It allows the user to register using appropriate username and password. 
The app also checks the password strength. It also uses AES256 encryption standards. 
Then, in login page, it checks the entered password with the master password and either allows or disallows the user from accessing the service which is a tableView.
